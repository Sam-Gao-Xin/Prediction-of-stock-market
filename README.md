# Prediction-of-stock-market
This is just a simple showcase of what I have learnt from many classes
I have applied many knowledge (basically many calls from python libraraies like pandas, nltk and sklearn)
I also split the work into 3 main parts(main, constant and tools)
I actually use different algos to test including regression,naives bayes and so on.
Please give me some feedback after you read these!
